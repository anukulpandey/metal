    <h3>A. SHEET METAL OPERATIONS</h3>
    <div class="morph" data-aos="fade-top">
    <h4>1. Shearing</h4>
    <div class="flexer">
        <div>
    <p>
        It is a cut in a straight line across a strip, sheet or bar. It leaves a
        lean edge on the piece of metal is sheared or cut. In this operation, a
        sheet metal workpiece is placed or kept Metal working 2 between two dies
        from one end. And, the punch is hit at the other end of the sheet,
        producing a shearing effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        It has 3 basic stage 1. Plastic Deformation When a metal is placed between
        the upper and lower blades of the shear and pressure is applied, plastic
        deformation takes place. It extends into metal for about 5 to 40% of metal
        thickness. 2. Fracture At the point of greatest stress concentration
        fracture takes place. n 3. Shear Small fractures are found and the metal
        is sheared.

            It is an operation of cutting a whole piece from sheet metal. In which
            enough scrap is left all around as shown in fig. A punch and die is
            applied for this type of sheet metal operation

<div class="morph" data-aos="fade-right">
        <h4>3. Punching</h4>
        <div class="flexer">
            <p>
                It is an operation of producing circular holes on a sheet of metal by a
                punch and die. This is the exact opposite of blanking but the operation
                is nearly the same. A Punch and die are further used here such as
                blanking operations.

        <p>
            Piercing is the process in which desired shape holes are produced in a
            piece of sheet metal without eliminating any material from the sheet or
            removing a very small amount of material as shown in the figure. Both
            punch and die are also applied in this operation. The punch used in the
            piercing operation is usually bullet-shaped

                The trimming operation is also known as shaving operation. It is a
                finishing operation by removing the burrs from the cut edges is taken
                out in order to make edges smooth and also provide dimensional accuracy

            It is an operation of producing thin-walled hallows or vessel shaped
            parts from sheet metal. It can be divided into two categories: 1. Deep
            drawing The length of depth of the object to be drawn is deeper than its
            widt 2. shallow drawing The length of the object to be drawn is less
            than its width. The examples of drawing are pans, tubes and cams.

            It occurs when forces are applied to localized areas. Here the metal

            It is a quick and widely used way of forming ductile metals. It has
            different operations such as sizing, coining, riveting etc. 1. Sizing
            Sizing operation is a squeezing operation that reduces the thickness of
            the metal. The sizing is done in an open die and only the surface where
            the die and workpiece touch will be sized. 2. Coining It is a process of
            pressing metal in a die so that it flows into the die space. For example
            Medals, Coins, and Jewellery.

        <h3>B. METAL FORMING PROCESS</h3>
        <p>
            The products and components created by the different metal shaping
            processes are used in creating everything from scaffolding and heavy
            machinery to designing and creating microprocessors and artificial
            intelligence. Some of the most common types of metal forming techniques
            are:

            it involves continually feeding a long strip of metal through drum
            rollers to attain the desired cross-section.

            <p>
                process that forces metal through the die of the desired cross-section.
                Aluminum is primarily the extrusion of choice, though most other metals
                can be used,are relatively affordable

            Metal working 5 involves common sheet metal forming (usually), bending
            the metal workpiece to a predetermined angle by pinching it between a
            punch and a die.

            Stamping involves placing a flat metal sheet (or coil) into a stamping
            press, where a tool and die apply pressure to form the metal into a new
            shape or cut out a piece of the metal.

                cutting, left cutting and right cutting snips, each identified by the
                color of their handles. Metal working 6 Straight cutting snips usually
                have yellow handles. They cut straight lines and wide curves both left
                and right. Left cutting snips usually have red handles, and they cut
                both straight and tight curve lines to the left. right cutting snips
                usually have green handles, and they cut both straight lines and tight

                <p>It is a cutting tool .
                    Used to cut cylindrical hole on workpiece. Generally it is made of high
                    speed steel , if the material is hard we use carbide also. TYPES OF

        <p>It is a power tool which is used for making holes in material , it can also be used for
            coiling and twisting wires efficiently and quickly
            TWISTING SQUARE WIRE
            Using clamp , short nose plier and drill. This kind of twisting makes wire more stronger
            and straighter . It can be used for coiling , as a decorative material etc
            TWISTING 2 ROUND WIRES
            Using plier to secure those wires together on clamp and putting them in drill
            COILING WIRE ON MANDREL
            Using knitting needles as mandrel . Putting it in drill alongside wire and pulling trigger
            very slow while guiding the wire. The coil we get can be used in jewelry design
            COILING WIRE ON ANOTHER WIRE AS BASE
            IT is done in wire weaving works . Putting the core wire in drill and secure it.Then
            wrapping the end of wire in swivel using plier then connecting to clamp to avoid wire
            from twisting and just rotating.Now putting the other wire in drill next to the core wire
            and pulling the trigger slowly.</p>

        <p>Hand tools are preferred for the control on twisting u can get. Securing the wires as
            many needed upto 5 in holes and other side securing through clamp we can start
            rotating the handle to get the twists.</p>

        <p> you can use them for thin wires.they have play jaws and handles to close them. At the
            end there is knob attached to a twisted rod which plays the important role in twisting the
            wire.After securing the wire in jaws and secure the other end using the clamp or any
            other suitable tool . then let go of the handles by pulling the knob out , repeatedly pull
            the knob out and let it go until you get the desired twist.</p>
